* Notes

[[https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.1.5.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/core.html#beans-annotation-config][This]] and the following section of the Spring documentation is a good
read before starting (this is for Spring 5.1.5, as used in this
project).

- [[https://github.com/alecigne/coding-katas/commit/a8f18e60fc158f12dc4494523d3d0462482333c0][a8f18e6]] :: Init. The tests won't pass since the "vehicle" instances
  are not even defined as Spring beans.

- [[https://github.com/alecigne/coding-katas/commit/bfc8da2da7a17235ef43f837a38832bd67171976][bfc8da2]] :: Compared to the [[file:ck0024_spring-di-xml-config.org][spring-di-xml-config]] kata/project, in
  this commit we introduce the DI annotations =@Autowired= and
  =@Qualifier=. Other annotations include =@PostConstruct=,
  =@PreDestroy=, =@Resource=...

  These annotation are detected with the following XML line:

  #+begin_src xml
    <context:annotation-config/>
  #+end_src

  The beans still have to be defined manually in =beans.xml=.

- [[https://github.com/alecigne/coding-katas/commit/a82d7365ae3bf3c43a47b4ea178b8ba274662269][a82d736]] :: Here we introduce the bean definition annotations
  (=@Component=, see also the other stereotype annotations). We also
  activate component scanning in =beans.xml=, otherwise the tests
  can't pass (it won't find the beans).
