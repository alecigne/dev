- Read a single Excel file sent from a REST API: a list of members
  with their membership ID, last name, first name and email adress.

- Validate the file

  + Columns are present
  + ID is valid
  + Email is valid

  An unvalid file will trigger a 400 BAD REQUEST with a custom list of
  validation errors (mentioning the Excel line when
  applicable). Otherwise, the response will be a 202 ACCEPTED. The
  processing will be asynchronous.

- Process the data:

  + Send the IDs in parallel, 3 by 3, to a dummy webservice that will
    return a map (ID / age of the member).

  + From this information, create the complete entity

  + Persist these entities in a MySQL database
