#+TITLE: =ionic-crud=

[[file:../../code/ionic-crud/][Project]] created on [2018-10-24 Wed].

An Ionic version of the [[file:angular-extended-tour-of-heroes.org][angular-extended-tour-of-heroes]]
interface. Inspired by [[https://www.djamware.com/post/5b5cffaf80aca707dd4f65aa/building-crud-mobile-app-using-ionic-4-angular-6-and-cordova][this tutorial]] (or [[file:../.files/ionic-crud.pdf][see pdf backup]]).

* Startup

1. Launch the mock api:

   #+begin_src sh
     npm run api:start
   #+end_src

2. Serve the app:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     ionic serve -l
   #+END_SRC

   or

   #+begin_src sh
     npx ionic serve -l
   #+end_src

   if Ionic is not installed globally.

Note on [2020-08-06 Thu]: this is an old project and there was a
problem with =node-sass=. I fixed it with these commands:

#+begin_src sh
  npm rebuild node-sass --force
  npm install node-sass
#+end_src

* Project initialization

1. Create the project:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     ionic start ab_ionic-crud sidemenu --type=angular
   #+END_SRC

2. Install dependencies:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     npm install --save-dev @ionic/lab
     npm install --save-dev json-server
   #+END_SRC

* Project structure and implementation

cf. [[https://github.com/alecigne/js-adventures/tree/master/aa_etoh-web][Extended Tour of Heroes]]

The commands start with =ionic=. Examples:

- =ionic g m core= for a module
- =ionic g s core/services/hero= for a service
- =ionic g page modules/home= for a page (the module is created
  automatically)

Changes:

- Tweaking imports seems unsupported as yet - see [[https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/issues/678][this]]
- I had to use the =ionViewWillEnter= lifecycle method to reload the
  list of heroes

* TODOs

- [ ] Update documentation
