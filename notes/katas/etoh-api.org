#+TITLE: =etoh-api=

[[file:../../code/etoh-api/][Project]] created on [2018-10-22 Mon].

This project capitalizes on [[file:spring-boot-minimal.org][=spring-boot-minimal=]] to build a very
simple backend for the [[file:angular-extended-tour-of-heroes.org][Extended Tour of Heroes (ETOH) Angular
frontend]].

It uses an in-memory H2 database initialized automatically by Spring
Boot, through a =data.sql= file in =src/main/resources/=.

* Startup

To get all heroes:

#+begin_src sh
  mvn clean spring-boot:run
  curl localhost:8080/api/heroes
#+end_src

NB: see [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/43574427][this SO answer]] for running the project with Java >8.

To access the H2 console, go to
=http://localhost:8080/h2-console/=. Credentials:

- JDBC URL: =jdbc:h2:mem:testdb=
- Username: =sa=

* TODOs

- [ ] Fix bug: can't rename a hero
