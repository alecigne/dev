[[file:../../code/spring-di-java-config/][Project]] created on [2019-03-27 Wed].

Check the [[file:../themes/spring.org][Spring theme]] for a more detailed view of dependency

The goal here is to showcase the "JavaConfig" style of configuration
(~@Configuration~) for DI, without annotation-based injection.
