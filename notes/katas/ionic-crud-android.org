#+TITLE: =ionic-crud-android=

[[file:../../code/ionic-crud-android/][Project]] created on [2018-11-12 Mon].

#+HTML: <p align="center"><img src="../.files/ionic-crud-android.png" /></p>

This is the continuation of three projects:

- [[file:angular-extended-tour-of-heroes.org][=angular-extended-tour-of-heroes=]] (ETOH), a slightly modified Tour
  of Heroes application

- [[file:ionic-crud.org][=ionic-crud=]], the same application built with Ionic

- [[file:cordova-helloworld.org][=cordova-helloworld=]], a minimal Cordova application to illustrate
  Android emulation

The goal is now to emulate the Ionic version of ETOH on a virtual
Android device.

The database was switched from =json-server= to =in-memory-web-api=
for practical reasons so nothing will be /really/ persistent.

The app name and icon were edited in =config.xml= and
=./resources/android/icon/= respectively.

* Startup

See [[file:cordova-helloworld.org][=cordova-helloworld=]] first for reference and tips.
