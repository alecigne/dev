Code written and notes taken along my learning journey as a software
developer.

This repository is an evergrowing, experimental "PKMS" -- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management][personal
knowledge management]] system -- based on:

- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]]
- [[https://www.orgmode.org/fr/][Org-mode]]
- [[https://www.orgroam.com/][Org-roam]]
- [[https://github.com/nobiot/org-transclusion][Org-transclusion]]
- [[https://magit.vc/][Magit]] (with [[https://github.com/magit/orgit][orgit]])
- etc.

As such, although Org markup is rendered quite nicely, it is not meant
to be browsable "as-is" on GitHub.
