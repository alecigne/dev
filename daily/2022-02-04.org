[[id:7a8ad25f-cd7f-492a-8c8e-2ffc28f38b49][HtDP]]: ex. 27 to 31.

Lost some time trying to configure [[https://github.com/greghendershott/racket-mode][racket-mode]]. Finally settled on a
"one-file per exercise" organization. It's way simpler to run
=racket-run= on these small files than on one big file with
conflicting definitions.

31/528 exercises done - 5.87% :smiley:
