Just rereading my notes on [[id:5c19e8cd-da2b-4c0b-8bf7-5d5f6288b49a][Clojure for the Brave and True]] a little bit
and practicing a little bit. As usual, I'm thinking again about
studying more "fundamental" books:

- [[id:7a8ad25f-cd7f-492a-8c8e-2ffc28f38b49][How to Design Programs]] (HtDP)

- [[https://www.plai.org/][Programming Languages: Application and Interpretation]] (PLAI)

- [[https://papl.cs.brown.edu/][Programming and Programming Languages]] (PAPL)

- Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)

- [[https://dcic-world.org/][A Data-Centric Introduction to Computing]] (DCIC)
